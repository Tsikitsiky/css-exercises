  <p>In case of a content larger than its container, the browser use the overflow: visible property value as default way to deal with.</p>
  <p>Ellipsis is a value of the text-overflow property which shows some parts of an element.It is different from ellipse because ellipse is a circle shape.</p>
  <p>Text-overflow only affects content that is overflowing a block container element in its inline progression direction.</p>
